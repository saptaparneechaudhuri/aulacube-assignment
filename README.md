# Question 1:

Describe a Complex Frontend Project Experience

I am a physics post graduated turned web developer. My first project was with Drupal and I had to code apis and integrate them as well. As a newbie in this field it was very challenging for me during the first few weeks. But as I persevered, it gradually became easier.
I wanted to explore the React framework and out of my own interest I took courses and started coding few small projects which could be found on my github repo.
So far my challenging project was user authentication using the MERN stack.
